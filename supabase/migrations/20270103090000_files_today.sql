-- 0123 · Files to complete: today's only, earlier days when the period asks for them.
--
-- Frank (owner): earlier days must show nothing "except when he filters to that date". The list
-- and the menu count give the files of patients registered or arrived TODAY (Kigali); the panel's
-- period (Today · This week · … · Custom) reads files_to_complete_in(from, to) for other days.
-- files_to_complete() stays (older screens) and now gives today's list.
